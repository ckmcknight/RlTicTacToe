# RlTicTacToe
An Android app that learns to play Tic Tac Toe as you play against it. This project was put together as a super quick way to refamiliarize myself with some android basics before the start of an internship. As such the UI is simply designed to work and is not the prettiest.

Currently The Tic Tac Toe game is in a usable form. The opponent just plays randomly. I have not yet started work on the learning part of the app.

TODO:
Start working to the RL Agent that learns to play as the user plays against it.
